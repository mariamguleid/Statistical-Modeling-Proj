# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Succesfully request data from API's and store data into dataframes. Join the data into one dataset and put dataset into an SQLlite
Database. 

## Process
### Send an API request to citybikes API to get all bike stations in Toronto, and store results into a dataframe.
### Send an API request to Foursquare API and yelp API for places in each stations lattitude/longitude. Parse through response and store details into a dataframe.
### Explore data from both API results using visualizations.
### Merged Yelp results with citybikes results into one table.
### Stored the merged tables into an SQLite database
### Attempting to create a simple linear regression model

## Results
Found that Yelp API provided better results as there were more columns and rows returned.

## Challenges 
Sending API requests was time consuming and took a lot of troubleshooting.

## Future Goals
Explore more columns in the datasets and create more visualizations and models to understand the data better.
